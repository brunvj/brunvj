#### Look forward to my projects:
- Object detection using TFLite, Android, and a custom-engineered tiny-UAV on the [Google Dev Board Mini](https://coral.ai/products/dev-board-mini/)
- Various C/C++ projects
- Various VHDL/Verilog projects on the [Pynq-Z2 Kit](https://www.xilinx.com/support/university/xup-boards/XUPPYNQ-Z2.html)
